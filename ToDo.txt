learn how to work with array datatype, to make ray storage better
get the position functions for the ray-wall collisions
make gui
learn how to work with json files
make two part render function
part one: the render takes the physics data and paints the rays onto the walls
part two: wipes the data and screen upon mouse movement
work out how to make the physics loop and the render loop independent (multithreading and processing)
